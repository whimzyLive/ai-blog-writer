# Next.JS Fundamentals

Are you looking for a framework to build enterprise applications with React? Look no further than Next.JS. In this blog post, we will cover the fundamentals of Next.JS and how it can help you build powerful applications.

## Introduction

Next.JS is a React-based web framework used for building enterprise applications. It provides features like server-side rendering and static site generation, which can help optimize your application's performance and improve your user's experience.

## Key Points

### Page

Pages are the basic building blocks of any Next.JS application. The framework uses the `page.js` file to perform server-side rendering of the components. 

### Link

Link component is used for client-side navigation with server-side routing. It automatically prefetches the content and improves page load time by reducing the number of requests made by the browser.

### Layout

Next.JS provides a layout component that can be used for sharing common components across pages. The layout is either based on the page or folder. You can create a `layout.js` file to define the layout for the pages in the folder.

### Fonts

You can use the `@next/font` package to automatically host and serve your fonts. Simply load your fonts from the `@next/font/{google|local}` package.

### Style

Next.JS scopes the styles to nested pages. It means the CSS classes defined in one page won't affect another page.

### Global Style

To apply global styles, you need to import the global style file to the global layout file.

### Image

Next.JS provides a built-in image component that optimizes the image size and provides visual stability by reducing layout shifts caused by loading images.

### Static Data Fetching

Static site generation is used to fetch and cache the static data during the build time. Next.JS has a default fetch API that caches the response to improve the page's load time.

### Dynamic Data Fetching

For dynamic data fetching, you can use the fetch API with the `"cache - no-store"` option to prevent caching of the response.

## Conclusion

Next.JS is a powerful framework that can help you build fast and optimized applications. It provides various features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. By using Next.JS, you can improve the performance of your application and provide a better experience to your users.
